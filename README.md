# horizon-operator

The Horizon Operator deploys the OpenStack Horizon project in a OpenShift cluster.

## Description

This project should be used to deploy the OpenStack Horizon project. It expects that there is an existing Keystone and Memcached service available to connect to.

## Getting Started

This operator is deployed via Operator Lifecycle Manager as part of the OpenStack Operator bundle:
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-operator

To configure Horizon specifically, we expose options to add custom configuration and the number of replicas for both Horizon API and Horizon Engine:

The following is taken from the Sample config in this repo:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 1
  secret: "osp-secret"
  customServiceConfig: |
    SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600
```

We can see in this example, that we're making some customizations to the config. In this case, we're using `SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600`.

Customisations are added to the `horizon-config-data` ConfigMap. If we look at a default ConfigMap with no customizations, we can see it has the following Keys:
```sh
❯ oc get cm horizon-config-data -o jsonpath={.data} | jq '. | keys'
[
  "9999_custom_settings.py",
  "horizon.json",
  "httpd.conf",
  "local_settings.py",
  "ssl.conf"
]
```
Any user provided customizations will go into the `9999_custom_settings.py` section. Without any customizations, it will just contain the default description:
```sh
❯ oc get cm horizon-config-data -o jsonpath={.data} | jq '."9999_custom_settings.py"'
"# add your customization here"
```

After applying our changes via the `OpenStackControlPlane` Custom Resource, we can see that this is now populated with our custom `SESSION_TIMEOUT` setting:
```sh
❯ oc patch openstackcontrolplane/openstack -p '{"spec": {"horizon": {"template": {"customServiceConfig": "SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600" }}}}' --type=merge
openstackcontrolplane.core.openstack.org/openstack patched

❯ oc get cm horizon-config-data -o jsonpath={.data} | jq '."9999_custom_settings.py"'
"SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600"
```


We can see this change reflected in the `/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.d/9999_custom_settings.py` file within the Horizon pod:

```sh
❯ oc get po -l service=horizon
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
horizon-65c6b8fff8-8sqr9   0/1     Running   0          63s


❯ oc exec horizon-65c6b8fff8-8sqr9 -- cat /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.d/9999_custom_settings.py
SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600%
```

### Running on the cluster

To enable the Horizon service, we simply need to set the Horizon service to enabled in the `OpenStackControlPlane`.
The following snippet is taken from the `OpenStackControlPlane` Custom Resource:

```yaml
❯ oc get openstackcontrolplane openstack -o yaml | yq .spec.horizon
enabled: true
template:
  containerImage: ""
  customServiceConfig: SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600
  debug:
    service: false
  preserveJobs: false
  replicas: 1
  resources: {}
  secret: osp-secret
```

### Memcached
Horizon uses the default memcached service deployed via the `OpenStackControlPlane`. This service should be enabled by default, but can be verified like so:
```sh
❯ oc get openstackcontrolplane openstack -o yaml | yq .spec.memcached.enabled
true
```

By default, this instance of memcached is simply called `memcached` and we will default to that name:
```go
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Required
	// +kubebuilder:default=memcached
	// Memcached instance name.
	MemcachedInstance string `json:"memcachedInstance"`
```

However, if a dedicated instance of memcached has been deployed, Horizon can be informed about this using the `spec.memcachedInstance` key like so:
```yaml
enabled: true
template:
  containerImage: ""
  customServiceConfig: SESSION_TIMEOUT = 3600
  debug:
    service: false
  preserveJobs: false
  replicas: 1
  resources: {}
  secret: osp-secret
  memcachedInstance: my-custom-memcached #<<-- Custom memcached instance supplied here.
```

### Undeploy controller

To undeploy the operator, simply set the `enabled` value to false from within the `OpenStackControlPlane` resource.

## Contributing

The following guide relies on a already deployed `OpenStackControlPlane`. If you don't already have this, you can
follow the guides located on the following repo:
https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/install_yamls

To contribute, you can disabled the Horizon service in the `OpenStackControlPlane` resouce and run the Operator locally
from your laptop using `make install run`. This will start the operator locally, and debugging can be done without
building and pushing a new container.

Once you have tested your feature, you can use `pre-commit run --all-files` to ensure the change passes preliminary
testing.

Ensure you have created an issue against the project and send a PR linking to the relevant issue. You can reach out
to the maintainers from the included OWNERS file for change reviews.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
